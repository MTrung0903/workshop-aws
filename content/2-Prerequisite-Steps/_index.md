#### Preparation Steps
**Information**: Before deploying Amazon RDS, you need to set up the appropriate network and security environment. The following steps will help you prepare the necessary infrastructure.

1. Create a VPC - A separate virtual network environment for your AWS resources
2. Create a subnet - Segment the network within the VPC for a multi-AZ deployment
3. Create a Security Group for Amazon EC2 - Control network traffic to and from the application server
4. Create a Security Group for a DB instance - Control network access to the RDS database
5. Create a DB Subnet group - Define the subnets that Amazon RDS can use in your VPC
